# OverTheWire Natas Project Part #1

## Student Information

* Student name: **Michael Cox**
* NetId: **mcox59**


## Project Description

In this project, you will be complete the Natas challenges at <https://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/>. In this part of the lab, you will complete challenges Natas 0â€“Natas 13. For each challenge, you will complete the following worksheet describing:
1. The credentials found in the challenge.
2. How you solved the challenge. Include any JavaScript or other scripts necessary to retrieve the credentials.
3. What sins (as found in the *24 Deadly Sins* book) are evidenced in the challenge.
4. How those sins should be addressed to address your exploit.

In the workshop, the challenges are named based on the username used to login to the shell for that challenge. For example, the challenge labeled "Natas 10" will be logged into with the username natas10, and the solution will be the credentials for the user Natas11.

You can find a basic guide for markdown formatting [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). In particular, note the [code section](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#code) which should be used to annotate any code or commands used in your writeup.


## Hints
* Natas 11: `plaintext ^ key` gives the ciphertext. What does `plaintext ^ ciphertext` equal?

#### Credentials
`natas1:gtVrDuiDfck831PqWsLEZy5gyDz1clto`

#### How you passed the challenge
* The password is stored in a comment in the html page

#### What sins are evidenced in this challenge
* [CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/312.html)
* [CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/319.html)

### Natas 01

#### Credentials
`natas2:ZluruAthQk7Q2MqmDeTiUij2ZvWy2mBi`

#### How you passed the challenge
* The password is stored in a comment in the html page
  * Use browser dev tools

#### What sins are evidenced in this challenge
* [CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/312.html)
* [CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/319.html)
* [CWE-540: Inclusion of Sensitive Information in Source Code](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/540.html)

* Use HTTPS (securely encrypt any sensitive information going through public channels)
* Securely hash passwords
* Use these mitigations rather than attempting to hide the vulnerability by removing functionality
