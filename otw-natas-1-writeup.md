# OverTheWire Natas Project Part #1

## Student Information

* Student name: **Michael Cox**
* NetId: **mcox59**


## Project Description

In this project, you will be complete the Natas challenges at <https://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/>. In this part of the lab, you will complete challenges Natas 0â€“Natas 13. For each challenge, you will complete the following worksheet describing:
1. The credentials found in the challenge.
2. How you solved the challenge. Include any JavaScript or other scripts necessary to retrieve the credentials.
3. What sins (as found in the *24 Deadly Sins* book) are evidenced in the challenge.
4. How those sins should be addressed to address your exploit.

In the workshop, the challenges are named based on the username used to login to the shell for that challenge. For example, the challenge labeled "Natas 10" will be logged into with the username natas10, and the solution will be the credentials for the user Natas11.

You can find a basic guide for markdown formatting [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). In particular, note the [code section](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#code) which should be used to annotate any code or commands used in your writeup.


## Hints
* Natas 11: `plaintext ^ key` gives the ciphertext. What does `plaintext ^ ciphertext` equal?

### Natas 00

#### Credentials
`natas1:gtVrDuiDfck831PqWsLEZy5gyDz1clto`

#### How you passed the challenge
* The password is stored in a comment in the html page

#### What sins are evidenced in this challenge
* [CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/312.html)
* [CWE-540: Inclusion of Sensitive Information in Source Code](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/540.html)

#### How could those sins be mitigated
* Remove the password from the HTML (do not store sensitive information in any publicly accessible files)
* Securely hash passwords
